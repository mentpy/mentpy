Welcome to MentPy's documentation
=================================

.. admonition:: Note
   :class: warning
   
   MentPy is in its alpha version and is under active development.

The :obj:`mentpy` library is an open-source Python package for creating and training quantum machine learning (QML) models 
in the measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) framework. This library contains functions
to automatically calculate the causal flow or generalized flow of a graph and tools to analyze the 
expressivity of the MBQC ansatzes.


Features
--------

* Manipulation of graph states.
* Automatically calculate the causal flow or generalized flow of a graph.
* Simulate MBQC circuits.
* Optimize measurement angles in MBQC ansatzes used for QML.
* Create data and noisy data for training QML models.
* Determine the lie algebra of an MBQC ansatz.

Roadmap
-------
* Improve current simulators for MBQC circuits.
* Increase code coverage.
* Add autodiff support for MBQC circuits.
* Add support for more general MBQC states.
* Integrate with `pyzx` to optimize resources in MBQC circuits.

Luis would like to thank his M.Sc. supervisors, Dr. Dmytro Bondarenko, Dr. Polina Feldmann, and Dr. Robert Raussendorf 
for their guidance during the development of this library.
